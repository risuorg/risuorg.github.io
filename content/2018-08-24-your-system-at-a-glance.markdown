### System information summary

Thanks to the suggestion of a colleague, we've added 'sysinfo' as a 'profile'.

The idea of this, together with the `RC_INFO` code introduced is to leverage some scripts that report information relevant to the system being analyzed, that might or not be a problem, but still gives you `context information` about what you're trying to diagnose.

Based on this, and by adjusting `sysinfo.txt` profile, for example to create a `sysinfo-openstack.txt` or a `sysinfo-openshift.txt` and its include/exclude filters for keywords, different set of tables could be created for relevant information for diagnosis/interpretation of failed/skipped/okay tests.

Have a look on how it might look like based on current [Gerrit reviews](https://review.gerrithub.io/c/Risuorg/Risu/+/423423):

And for example, for OSP:

Enjoy and contribute the System information you'll like to see!
