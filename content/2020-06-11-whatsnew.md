## What's new?

Other posts in this category: [What's new]({tag}whatsnew)

### General

- Extra plugin tree support: allows to specify alternate plugin tree (in addition to internal one) so that Risu can be integrated more easily with other solutions (for example, excluding `Risuclient` plugins and just listing the ones in the additional folder)
- Some minor fixes in documentation and plugins
- New logo!
