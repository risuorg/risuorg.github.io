## What's new?

Our previous edition of What's new was stored externally at <https://iranzo.github.io/blog/2018/01/16/recent-changes-in-magui-and-citellus/>, so we've copied to this website for completeness (now locally at: [Whats new]({filename}2018-01-16-recent-changes-in-magui-and-citellus.markdown))

What has happened since then?

- We're presenting at SuperSec 2018 in Almería, Spain [SuperSec 2018]({filename}2018-04-16-supersec.md)
- Up to 217 plugins as of today
- Lot of code changes

Some of the changes include...

- Framework (citellus and magui)

  - Python optimizations
    - Removed duplicated code
    - Declare variables to remove to reduce memory footprint
    - On magui, save earlier instead of running twice (with lot of sosreports it was an issue)
    - Limit magui checks by default to 10 sosreports at the same time or exit
    - Use absolute paths internally when working on sosreports
  - Autogroups
    - Magui does now check possible groups based on metadata to compare sosreports between them in addition to 'all against all' to highlight issues that affect 'controllers', or 'computers', or host UUID across sosreports.
  - In Live mode, just run plugins that pass filter
  - Progress bars for each plugin
  - Split Faraday results into individual plugins, so each interface/device appears 'paired' across sosreports
