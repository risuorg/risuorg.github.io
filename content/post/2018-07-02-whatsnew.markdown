## What's new?

Other posts in this category: [What's new]({tag}whatsnew)

### General

- RC_INFO
  - We had discussions in the past about info that we could provide that was not really a `Error`. After some extra feedback we did add the RC_INFO exit code to the tests, so that for example `xsos` output is also provided with Risu results so that it can be quickly checked also from the Web UI
- `overrides.json`
  - Allows to override fields in the results json with some values, for example to force updates of the titles, urls, etc in the results returned.
- `--anon`
  - Allows to anonymize results by removing contents of `err` and `out` fields in `Risu.json` so that it doesn't leak any information.
- `rhv-log-collector-analyzer-live` support.
  - Risu now does report on `live` executions the information reported from `rhv-log-collector-analizer-live --json` thanks to the great work done by Douglas Landgraf.
- Since commit [`9505c0cca15c5d55cdf5dbd7b5a1e271f03f7234`](https://github.com/Risuorg/Risu/commit/9505c0cca15c5d55cdf5dbd7b5a1e271f03f7234) we've removed plugins that were previously made available as we were requested.
