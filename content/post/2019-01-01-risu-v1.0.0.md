During the las months Risu team has not found any big issues or functionality that could be missed and worked mostly on performance improvements and some other tests.

It was a good timing to align a new year with official release of [Risu 1.0.0](https://github.com/Risuorg/Risu/releases/tag/V1.0.0).

We've recently also embraced a new telegram chat for our users via <https://t.me/RisuUG> to contact our team and for driving further development and evolution.

Join us in celebrating 2009 with a new full set of opportunities and challenges to rise up!

Regards!
