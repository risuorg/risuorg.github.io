## What's new?

Other posts in this category: [What's new]({{< ref "/tags/whatsnew" >}})

### General

- anonymizaton
  - We've moved this to an independent function and updated the '--call-home <serveruri>' to use this function (but leaving sosreport path), so that the results can be aggregated later for checking trends on rules detecting issues, etc.
- metrics
  - As part of above change, we've started a small spinoff that we want to integrate back into Nexus on grabbing metrics of execution we can later analyze. Code is very simple and it's just a simple receiving HTTP POST server that stores the `json` on disk for later analysis. Note: Metrics are enabled on demand by setting the `--call-home` parameter to YOUR server uri.
