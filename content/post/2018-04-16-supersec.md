## Risu at SuperSec 2018!!

We're pleased to [announce](https://supersec.es/programa/) that Risu will be present in Almer√≠a, Spain during 12-13 May SuperSec congress.

Supersec focuses on Secure development of software and there, Risu has something to say...

Risu as you know is valid for validating that a deployed system is safe against known issues at any level: configuration, package versioning, security, etc

Recently we've also extended Risu to better behave with not only Red Hat ecosystem of products, but also expanded to increase tests on:

- Red Hat based distributions (CentOS, Fedora)
- RDO: <rdoproject.org> (Upstream for Red Hat OpenStack)
- Debian: initial support for package checking
- A colleague has also been testing on top of Arch Linux

We wish to see you there and get you onboard!
