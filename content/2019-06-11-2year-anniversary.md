## Time flies!

![We're 2 year old]({attach}images/2year.jpg)

Today, Citellus makes the two years milestone.

Last year we got [this article]({filename}2018-06-11-1year-anniversary.markdown) on it.

This year not a lot of changes happened compared to the last one:

- The amount of plugins have increased to 874 (counting internal ones)
    - Updates to some plugins like lifecycle of new releases
- Our first Katacoda scenario on how to install and use it: [How to use citellus](https://www.katacoda.com/iranzo/scenarios/citellus)
- Presentation on meetup [Emerging Tech Valencia](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Emerging-Tech-Valencia/)

Thanks a lot for all your support during this period and counting on it for the years to come!

Do [contribute]({filename}/pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get us to the next level!

Happy birthday Citellus!!
