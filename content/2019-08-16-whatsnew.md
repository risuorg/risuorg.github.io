## What's new?

Other posts in this category: [What's new]({tag}whatsnew)

### General

- Improve handling of dates forcing `LC_ALL`
- Create a new function (thanks Mikel) to take from an ordered list of files the `first_file_available` and exits (because sometimes, depending on sosreport version it might have one file or another).
- Patternfly was updated to latest minor
- Other changes made to `is_active` and `is_enabled`
- Functions that were later enhanced to use `first_file_available`
- Test to detect issues with `LEAPP` in-place upgrade for EL7->EL8 if / and /var are on different device.ç
