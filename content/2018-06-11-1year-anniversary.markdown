## Time flies!

![We're 1 year old]({attach}images/1year.jpg)

When you look back in time, some dates are more important than others because of what they bring to memory, for us `Sun Jun 11 12:45:38 2017 +0200` is a special date...

One year ago, this `commit` <https://github.com/Risuorg/Risu/commit/fd5e56fbd946ba12aaef5e3776c341c4eab6b882> from Robin, demonstrated our commitment to make issue diagnostics faster and easier by putting automation and `Risu` was born.

Since then, lot of [new things happened]({tag}whatsnew):

- Framework rewritten in python, parallelism, filters, etc
- Code review, Unit testing
- Extra contributors joined the project: <https://github.com/Risuorg/Risu/graphs/contributors>
- Web Interface
- More than 670+ plugins
- Presented on some public and also internal events that demonstrated the low-entry barrier on getting things detected.
  - [DevConf.cz 2018](https://devconfcz2018.sched.com/event/DJXG/detect-pitfalls-of-osp-deployments-with-Risu): [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDzzqrUdn5A&t=1257s&index=1&list=LLyqRUm2tl7NOBlSL4Gz0e_Q)
  - [SuperSec 2018](https://supersec.es/programa/)
  - etc.
- etc

Want some numbers?

- 1507 commits
- 480 issues (enhancements, etc) closed
- 28 contributors
- 54 'stars' on repo

Thanks a lot for all your support during this period and counting on it for the years to come!

Do [contribute]({filename}/pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get us to the next level!

Happy birthday Risu!!
