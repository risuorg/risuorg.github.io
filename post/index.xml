Risu has been now around for three years!
On June 11th 2017 I have created this project for automating manual checks that I had to perform over and over again. It was very simple shell script that iterated over directories and executed shell scripts in them.
Soon after that, friends, colleagues started to use the program as well and provided feedback. We have reached out for help to one of our colleague Lars and asked if he had any ideas he could share with us to improve the program.</description></item><item><title>Risu: What's new? 2020-06-11</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2020-06-11-whatsnew/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:50:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2020-06-11-whatsnew/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s new?

General Improve handling of dates forcing LC_ALL Create a new function (thanks Mikel) to take from an ordered list of files the first_file_available and exits (because sometimes, depending on sosreport version it might have one file or another).

Today, Risu makes the two years milestone.
Last year we got this article on it.
This year not a lot of changes happened compared to the last one:
The amount of plugins have increased to 874 (counting internal ones) Updates to some plugins like lifecycle of new releases Our first Katacoda scenario on how to install and use it: How to use Risu Presentation on meetup Emerging Tech Valencia Thanks a lot for all your support during this period and counting on it for the years to come!</description></item><item><title>Risu 1.0.0 released!!</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2019-01-01-risu-v1.0.0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2019-01-01-risu-v1.0.0/</guid><description>During the las months Risu team has not found any big issues or functionality that could be missed and worked mostly on performance improvements and some other tests.
It was a good timing to align a new year with official release of Risu 1.0.0.
We&amp;rsquo;ve recently also embraced a new telegram chat for our users via https://t.me/RisuUG to contact our team and for driving further development and evolution.

System information summary Thanks to the suggestion of a colleague, we&amp;rsquo;ve added &amp;lsquo;sysinfo&amp;rsquo; as a &amp;lsquo;profile&amp;rsquo;.
The idea of this, together with the RC_INFO code introduced is to leverage some scripts that report information relevant to the system being analyzed, that might or not be a problem, but still gives you context information about what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to diagnose.
Based on this, and by adjusting sysinfo.</description></item><item><title>Risu: What's new? 2018-07-08</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-08-whatsnew/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2018 18:25:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-08-whatsnew/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s new?

General anonymizaton We&amp;rsquo;ve moved this to an independent function and updated the &amp;lsquo;&amp;ndash;call-home &amp;rsquo; to use this function (but leaving sosreport path), so that the results can be aggregated later for checking trends on rules detecting issues, etc. metrics As part of above change, we&amp;rsquo;ve started a small spinoff that we want to integrate back into Nexus on grabbing metrics of execution we can later analyze.</description></item><item><title>Risu: What's new? 2018-07-02</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-02-whatsnew/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 18:25:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-02-whatsnew/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s new?

General RC_INFO We had discussions in the past about info that we could provide that was not really a Error. After some extra feedback we did add the RC_INFO exit code to the tests, so that for example xsos output is also provided with Risu results so that it can be quickly checked also from the Web UI overrides.json Allows to override fields in the results json with some values, for example to force updates of the titles, urls, etc in the results returned.</description></item><item><title>Risu: 1 year anniversary</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-06-11-1year-anniversary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 12:45:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-06-11-1year-anniversary/</guid><description>Time flies!

One year ago, this commit https://github.com/Risuorg/Risu/commit/fd5e56fbd946ba12aaef5e3776c341c4eab6b882 from Robin, demonstrated our commitment to make issue diagnostics faster and easier by putting automation and Risu was born.

During recent weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve been coding and performing several changes to Risu and Magui.
Checking the latest logs or list of issues open and closed on github is probably not an easy task or the best way to get &amp;lsquo;up-to-date&amp;rsquo; with changes, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to compile a few here.
First of all, we&amp;rsquo;re going to present it at Devconf.cz 2018, so come stop-by if assisting :-)
