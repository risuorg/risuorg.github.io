General Improve handling of dates forcing LC_ALL Create a new function (thanks Mikel) to take from an ordered list of files the first_file_available and exits (because sometimes, depending on sosreport version it might have one file or another). Patternfly was updated to latest minor Other changes made to is_active and is_enabled Functions that were later enhanced to use first_file_available Test to detect issues with LEAPP in-place upgrade for EL7-&amp;gt;EL8 if / and /var are on different device.</description></item><item><title>Risu 1.0.0 released!!</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2019-01-01-risu-v1.0.0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2019-01-01-risu-v1.0.0/</guid><description>During the las months Risu team has not found any big issues or functionality that could be missed and worked mostly on performance improvements and some other tests.

System information summary Thanks to the suggestion of a colleague, we&amp;rsquo;ve added &amp;lsquo;sysinfo&amp;rsquo; as a &amp;lsquo;profile&amp;rsquo;.
The idea of this, together with the RC_INFO code introduced is to leverage some scripts that report information relevant to the system being analyzed, that might or not be a problem, but still gives you context information about what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to diagnose.
Based on this, and by adjusting sysinfo.</description></item><item><title>Risu: What's new? 2018-07-08</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-08-whatsnew/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2018 18:25:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-08-whatsnew/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s new?

General anonymizaton We&amp;rsquo;ve moved this to an independent function and updated the &amp;lsquo;&amp;ndash;call-home &amp;rsquo; to use this function (but leaving sosreport path), so that the results can be aggregated later for checking trends on rules detecting issues, etc. metrics As part of above change, we&amp;rsquo;ve started a small spinoff that we want to integrate back into Nexus on grabbing metrics of execution we can later analyze.</description></item><item><title>Risu: What's new? 2018-07-02</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-02-whatsnew/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 18:25:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-07-02-whatsnew/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s new?

General RC_INFO We had discussions in the past about info that we could provide that was not really a Error. After some extra feedback we did add the RC_INFO exit code to the tests, so that for example xsos output is also provided with Risu results so that it can be quickly checked also from the Web UI overrides.json Allows to override fields in the results json with some values, for example to force updates of the titles, urls, etc in the results returned.</description></item><item><title>Risu featured on redhat.com blog</title><link>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-06-08-rhcomblog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2018 22:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://risuorg.github.io/post/2018-06-08-rhcomblog/</guid><description>Red Hat blog post!

During recent weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve been coding and performing several changes to Risu and Magui.
Checking the latest logs or list of issues open and closed on github is probably not an easy task or the best way to get &amp;lsquo;up-to-date&amp;rsquo; with changes, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to compile a few here.
First of all, we&amp;rsquo;re going to present it at Devconf.cz 2018, so come stop-by if assisting :-)
